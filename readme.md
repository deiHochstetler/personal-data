# Orange Method - Project 1
# Maintain Personal Data

## Introduction

This super simple employee self-service application allows an associate to view and maintain their personal data.  It reads data from an array, allows the associate to update the data, and pushes any updated data back into the array.

This application is maintained in GitHub and is using THD's UX StyleGuide.  There are also some NodeJS dependencies for the application.
